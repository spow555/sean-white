    <p class="bio">
      Hardworking and motivated individual looking to transition
      my 7 years of active duty leadership and experiance into the civilian workforce.
      I have been apart of a helpdesk team supporting more than 25,000 users. While assigned
      to the 1st Theater Sustainment command I assisted with the turn in of over 600 computers
      in the short amount of time I was there. While in a deployed environment, I was able to
      identify issues within my organizations helpdesk and created standard
      operation procedures that assisted in the tracking of over 750
      Remedy tickets. I have also been placed in leadership roles where
      I had to train and motivate other members of my team to accomplish our organizations mission.
      I'm actively seeking a network administration position.
